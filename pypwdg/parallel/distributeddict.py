'''
A framework for maintaining a distributed dictionary using MPI.

Distributed dictionaries have an essentially immutable set of keys (the immutability isn't
enforced, but it's recommended).  Within each process, some of these keys are "owned", 
meaning that that process is responsible for setting the values associated with the key.  
Each process also has access to the values for "unowned" keys (e.g. the data on the boundary
of a neighbouring process).  

ddicts are controlled by a ddictmanager.  Calling .sync() on the ddictmanager will ensure that
all values associated with unowned keys in each process are updated.  The ddictmanager 
optionally maintains a master copy of all the data.

Each ddict needs to be told what its owned and unowned keys are.  This is done using by a
dictinfo object, which must have getOwnedKeys() and getUnownedKeys() methods, which return 
the correct information for the current process.      

For the future: 
- Some kind of automatic sync-ing is possible, hooking directly into the messaging
infrastructure.  It would, however, add some overhead.  Not sure whether it's worth it.
- Automatic determination of unowned keys is also possible, although to be efficient,
that requires inter-worker-process communication, which we currently avoid.  It could
be done using MPI Windows, however Windows are not designed for unstructured data.
