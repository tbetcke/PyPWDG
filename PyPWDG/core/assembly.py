    """ Assemble a global matrix based on local inner products and structure matrices 
    
    We suppose that we want to assemble the matrix:
    
    diag(U_1, ... U_n)^H * S^t * diag(W_1 ... W_n) * T * diag(V_1 ... V_n)
    
    where the matrices satisfy the following conditions:
    - the number of rows in U_i = b_i = number of rows in V_i;
    - S and T have a block structure where the entries T_ij = S_ij = zeros(b_i, b_j) if b_i <> b_j. 
      If b_i = b_j then S_ij = s_ij * I and T_ij = t_ij * I where I is a b_i x b_i identity matrix.
    - W_i is a b_i x b_i diagonal matrix (and if any S_ij or T_ij is non-zero then W_i = W_j).
    
    Think: The block structure is at the face level; b_i is the number of quadrature points on each face; 
    U and V are Vandermonde matrices; S and T are structure matrices, e.g. representing averages or jumps 
    across faces; and W_i are the quadrature weights on each face.
    
    We can calculate the matrix by first calculating r = s^H * t and then taking each block as
    r_ij U_i^H * W_i * V_j.  That's what this class facilitates.  
    
    U and V are supplied as LocalVandermonde objects.  These supply values and normal derivatives 
    
    LocalInnerProduct objects are used to manage the blocks U_i^H * W_i * V_j for each of the 4 combinations of 
    values and normal derivatives.
    
    The assemble method accepts a 2x2 array of structure matrices, r.
